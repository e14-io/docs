# The Graph API

## Graph API Overview

The Graph API is the primary way to get data out of, and put data into, Facebook's platform. It's a low-level HTTP-based API that you can use to programmatically query data, post new stories, manage ads, upload photos, and perform a variety of other tasks that an app might implement.


### The Basics

The Graph API is named after the idea of a 'social graph' - a representation of the information on Facebook composed of:

- **nodes** - basically "things" such as a User, a Photo, a Page, a Comment
- **edges** - the connections between those "things", such as a Page's Photos, or a Photo's Comments
- **fields** - info about those "things", such as a person's birthday, or the name of a Page
